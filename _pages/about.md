**Smoking monitoring project** <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='DhtAFkwAAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC'></span></strong>

- This project is a real-time smoking detection system based on YOLOv8 and OpenVINO, supporting multi-channel video analysis with backend management and streaming access. I was responsible for the algorithm module, using FFmpeg to decode video streams and optimizing the YOLOv8n model with OpenVINO to detect smoking behavior and trigger alarms. The system enhances efficiency and stability through keyframe detection, result reuse, frame caching, and multi-threading, with on-demand alarm video generation and real-time streaming support.
